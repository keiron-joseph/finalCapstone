1. Product Description - This was the most complex task completed during the software enginnering bootcamp. I used lists or dictionaries and functions to extend thefunctionality of a simple task management system. This is a program designed fora small business to help it manage tasks assigned to each member of a team.

2. Installation Guide (Please ensure you have a code editor software like VS Code already installed on your computer. It can be downloaded here https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
   - Firstly click on the "task_manager.py" file to open it.
   - Click on the "Download raw file" button to download it to your local drive.
   - Create a folder on your local drive to move the file to and then move it there.
   - Open your code editor software and then within the software open the folder containing the file.
   - Lastly, open the file in the folder within the software. This will load the file to the code editor.

3. User Guide 
   - Click on the button that runs the file in your code editor so that the program loads in the terminal.
   - Initially you will have to login using the administartor login as nobody else will have been set up yet.
   - The login details are
         username = admin
         password = password
   - The program will display a menu with options to choose from. The menu options work as follows:
       - r - register user = This allows for new users to be added to the program. Users will be asked to create a username and password.
       - a - add task = This option creates takes. You will be asked for the user the task will be assigned to, the title of the task, a description of the task and the due date of the task. The program then displays the task details. 
       - va - view all tasks = This shows all the tasks created on the program for all users.
       - vm - view my task = This shows the tasks assigned to the user who is logged in. Once this has been selected the user is given the option to edit the task and assign it to someone else or mark it as complete.
       - gr - generate reports = Only the admin user can run this. This will create two reports. One called "task_overview.txt" which displayers the tasks statistics and one called "user_overview.txt" which displays the user statistics. If the files have already been                  created before it will update the files with the new statistics.
       - ds - display statistics = Only the admin can run this. The program will display task and user statistics.
       - e  - exit = This exits the program and logs the user out.
